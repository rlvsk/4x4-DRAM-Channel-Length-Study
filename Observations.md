## Key Observations from Channel Length Sweep

- Short channel length (180 nm):
  - Faster charging and discharging of storage capacitor
  - Higher access speed
  - Lower retention tendency

- Long channel length (up to 1000 nm):
  - Slower charge/discharge behavior
  - Reduced leakage
  - Better data retention characteristics

Conclusion:
The access transistor channel length plays a critical role in balancing DRAM speed and stability.
